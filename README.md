# TheGame

This is just a Simple Game to learn SDL2 and Game Development with.

History:
We met on Sololearn (sololearn.com) and decided we would try to collaborate to try and make a game with our new found skills! This is the result.

Special Thanks to:
sololearn - sololearn.com
lazyfoo lazyfoo.net
and the entire internet development community!
